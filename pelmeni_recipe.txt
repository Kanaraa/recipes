How to Make Basic Vareniky or Pelmeni Dough:
1. Using the whisk attachment on medium speed, mix together: 2/3 cup buttermilk, 1 Tbsp  of sour cream  2 cups warm water, 2 eggs and 1  1/2 tsp salt until well blended (please excuse the fact that this picture has the paddle attachment – I hauled my mixer to my sister’s house to make these and forgot the whisk!).
2. Switch to dough hook and add 4 cups flour. Mix on speed 2 until well blended.
3. Add 3 more cups of flour (one cup at a time and wait for the dough to become well blended with each cup). Add the rest of the flour 1 Tbsp at a time, until the dough is no longer sticking to the sides of the bowl (I used 6 Tbsp). Once it is no longer sticking to the bowl, continue to mix 5 minutes. (Total mixing time is about 20 minutes from the time you start adding flour).
4. Place the dough on a lightly floured surface.
